# Gene-Expression-Analysis
# R Code to filter expression data before submitting for Bioinformatic analysis
# This code is meant to separate upregulated and down regulated expression for preprocessing analysis. This is not recommended 
# for universal Bioinformatic analysis using integrated tools like DAVID as you may exclude genes integral to non-linear metabolic pathway analysis if you
# do not establish specific parameters for fold count or false discovery rate thresholds.
