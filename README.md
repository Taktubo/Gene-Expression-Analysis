# Gene-Expression-Analysis
#R Code to filter expression data before submitting for Bioinformatic analysis
#This code is meant to separate upregulated and down regulated expression for preprocessing analysis. This is not recommended 
#for Bioinformatic analysis using integrated tools like DAVID as you may exclude genes integral to non-linear metabolic pathway analysis.
